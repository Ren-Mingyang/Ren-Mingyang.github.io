## 2022

                   <img src="../images/grad.jpg" width="30%">   
Overall, it has been a memorable PhD journey for me, during which I have studied and lived in several places for a long period of time, including Huairou and Shijingshan District in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and New Haven. There is a Chinese proverb said, "Traveling thousands of miles is better than reading thousands of books", hope to have a richer journey in the future.
- **Jul. 1**, I received the ***[Chinese Academy of Sciences President Award](https://math.ucas.ac.cn/index.php/zh-CN/qyntz/2729-202)***, which might be a good ending to my PhD journey.       
- **May 19**, I passed the **PhD dissertation defense** online, which was an important day in my life. There are so many people to thank along the way. [[Acknowledgements for doctoral dissertation](./publications/Acknowledgement.pdf)]  
- **Jan. 12**, my first medical SCI article was accepted in ***Ophthalmology and Therapy***.

## 2021
- ***Year-end Summary***. It was a rewarding year, with the acceptance of all the statistical papers in my PhD work, completion of my doctoral dissertation, confirmation of my graduation destination, and marriage, just waiting to graduate. Hope the future is as fortunate as this year.
- **Dec. 1**, I came to CityU as a research assistant starting **a new and first journey in Hong Kong**. Frankly, I was surprised to feel that the Yuquan Road campus of UCAS is not really small comparing to CityU.

## 2020
- ***Year-end Summary***. It was a year of writing papers and delving into cooking uneventfully, trapped at home with little news.
- **Dec. 17**, I successfully returned home after the one-year joint Ph.D. program at "Jialidun" university! It was a hard journey during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. The main memory of this year, reluctantly, was the scenery of the four seasons outside the window, while it was not bad...

- **Sep. 24**, I received the **President Award of Academy of Mathematics and Systems Sciences**, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
- **Aug. 17**, my first SCI article was finally accepted by ***AISM*** after 2 years of submission and revision, which is perhaps the small start of my academic career.
- **May. 14**, the first time out of the house after about 2 months of working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
