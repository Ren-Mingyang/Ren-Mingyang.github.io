- *TransTGGM* [[CRAN]]. An R package for Transfer learning for tensor Gaussian graphical models.
Reference:  
[Transfer learning for tensor Gaussian graphical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09391), arXiv, 2022+.
- *HhP* [[CRAN]]. An R package for hierarchical heterogeneity analysis. The current version contains only regression-based supervised hierarchical heterogeneity analysis, and will be supplemented with Gaussian graphical model-based unsupervised methods in the next step.
